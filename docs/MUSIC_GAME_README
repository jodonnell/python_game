OK here we go

game is a shooting game
enemies movements and actions are based off music input

so on one side we need to program the straight up normal actions of the game and completely wall it off from the music

actions:
enemies can be generated
enemies can perform actions (attacks, not sure if anything else)
enemies can collide 



maybe a weapons class that bullets and lazers can derive frmo
bullets could have player bullets and other enemy bullets





############# SOUND

I could preprocess a sound file and store the data in a temp array then play the sound streaming


enemey movement hooked into sound
enemy attacks (them actually firing) hooked into sound 
enemy weapons (like the lazer itself) hooked into sound
background hooked into sound
your attack pattern can get bonuses based on sounds (maybe you can switch between frequencies and a light underneath you signals you to fire with the base or you can switch and fire with the treble etc)
enemy generation hooked into sounds



So maybe have a music controller class that takes the current sample and sends it out to all the different things at the time, observer pattern?

The observer would be delightful but this does not control WHAT subscribes to the Music class.  WHAT WILL SUBSCRIBE, everything or is this TOO based off the music?
