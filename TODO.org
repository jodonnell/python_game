* Game
** Currently you can both duck and jump, must figure out how to have two separate state machines talk
** Abstract states into usable by by other stateful objects as well as players
** Level init should use factory for object creation to append to level


All onscreen objects must be able to return there right and left absolete edge
** do_action returns the player movement.  this is not very sensible.
*** view has access to all things to check for collisions so view must be able to get unimpeded movenent before it determines actual movement
*** TODO one solution is to give the player access to all other objects via a registry
** TODO UNIT TESTS MOTHERFUCKERA
